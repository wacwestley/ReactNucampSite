# React_Nucampsite
This project is for the 3rd month of the Bootcamp.
It uses React to build the entire project.
I learned more about bootstrap and dived deep into learning about Javascript.
Yarn package manager is also used and to start the app use "yarn start".

BEFORE STARTING:
Please have separate repo running alongside the Nucampsite App.
