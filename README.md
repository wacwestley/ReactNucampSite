# React_Nucampsite
This project is for the 3rd month of the Bootcamp.
It uses React to build the entire project.
I learned more about bootstrap and dived deep into learning about Javascript.
Yarn package manager is being used this month instead of NPM.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

When you start you should be redirected to the "Home" page.
From there a responsive Navbar should guide you around.
Clicking the logo will redirect to the "Home" page.
At the footer are hyperlinks to various places.

If you attempt to login it will echo back the info you input preparing for
    when I learn backend later in the course.
Upon pressing the login button a responsive Modal will toggle.

If you navigate to "Directory" you will be greeted with 4 cards.
Clicking on any of these cards pulls up more info on each.
There is no real backend but you are still able to sumbit comments.

Navigating to the "About" page showcases different ways of styling.
Pictures of the Community Partners are being pulled from the very small
    backend server.

Finally the "Contact Us" page gives ways to reach out.
It includes a form to send Feedback as well.
The form uses validation to ensure the user is inputing an actual email,
    that the phone number is the right length, and that they have a name.
The form then echos back all the information that was input preparing for
    when I learn backend.
