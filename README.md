# React_Nucampsite
This project is for the 3rd month of the Bootcamp.
It uses React to build the entire project.
I learned more about bootstrap and dived deep into learning about Javascript.
Yarn package manager is being used this month instead of NPM.

BEFORE STARTING:
Please have separate repo running alongside the Nucampsite App.
"JSON_Server_React_Nucampsite"
https://github.com/wacwestley/JSON_Server_React_Nucampsite

ONCE JSON-SERVER IS RUNNING:
Begin by starting the app with "yarn start"
Please make sure you are traveling to http://localhost:3001 for all testing.
Once finished please type into your terminal "ctrl+c" to end the app.
